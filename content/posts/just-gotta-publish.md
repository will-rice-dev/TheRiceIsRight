## Hello there, new blog

Sometimes you just have to go for it. Too often, I get caught up in traps that keep me from pushing anything into a ✨*production*✨ environment. Is it better to write and be embarrassed than never write at all? That answer will differ from person to person, but it's about time I find out for myself. I'm going to commit to a post a week, with due dates on Mondays. Just going to see how it goes and how it feels.

## What's going to be on here?

Who knows? Definitely some coding stuff, maybe some sports stuff. Some updates on my blog journey as well. I'll try to tag it appropriately.

## Tree falling

Will anybody read this? Probably not. I have no immediate plans to advertise it. Ideally, this is my worst post. Maybe one day I'll feel great about a piece.
